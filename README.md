# YAML support for the Go language

This package is a pure port of the [libyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML)
C library for the Go language.

Import path
-----------

The yaml package should be imported as:

  * [gonuts.org/v1/yaml](https://gonuts.org/v1/yaml)

This URL works with "go get", and it also leads to the package documentation
if opened with a browser. The package API for yaml v1 will remain stable as
described in [gonuts.org](https://gonuts.org).
